## About
I am a platform engineer. I primarily work on building large-scale infrastructures. I am passionate about software and system design and ❤️ automating large-scale systems! I always question everything and challenge the current status quo to accomplish better results.


## 🔭 Aspiration 

My aspirations are building large-scale infrastructure toolings, breaking into kernel hacking and leading large teams toward essentialism.
